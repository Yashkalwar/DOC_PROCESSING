With that in \nmind Bray has introduced \nthe Tri Lok triple offset valve \nin sizes 3\" – 48\" in ASME \nClass 150 and 300, and 4\" – \n24\" in ASME Class 600.\nThe standard Bray Tri Lok \nproduct range allows for the \nfield replacement of both \nthe seal ring AND the valve \nseat which offers significant \nadvantages over triple \noffset valves with integral \nseats that are welded and \nmachined into the valve \nbody, and are therefore not \nreplaceable.\nAs well, the standard \nseat material for the Bray \nTri Lok triple offset valve is \nspecially nitride hardened \nmaking it considerably \nmore durable and therefore \nsuperior in performance \nand reliability even in \nharsh critical applications \nwhen compared to other \nproducts on the market. \nThis safe, simple, unique \ndesign differentiates the \nTri Lok product range by \nproviding end-users the \nability to repair their valves \nlocally rather than having \nto send them back to the \nmanufacturer, thus reducing \ndowntime and significantly \nlowering the total cost of \nownership.\nTotal Cost of Ownership Example\n24\" Class 150\n∆ %\n12\" Class 150\n∆ %\nTri Lok\nIntegral Seat\nTri Lok\nIntegral Seat\nInitial Cost\n$12,500\n$12,500\n0%\n$3,500\n$3,500\n0%\nInstallation Cost1\n$1,250\n$1,250\n0%\n$350\n$350\n0%\nRemoval Cost1\n$1,250\n$1,250\n0%\n$350\n$350\n0%\nRepair Cost2\n$1,250\nN/A\n$350\nN/A\nRepair Parts3\n$2,800\nN/A\n$883\nN/A\nReplacement Valve Cost\nN/A\n$12,500\nN/A\n$3,500\nTotal Cost of Ownership \n$19,050\n$27,500\n$5,433\n$7,700\nEstimated Savings\n$8,450\n31%\n$2,267\n29%\nNotes:\n1  Installation and removal cost assumed at 10% of the initial purchase price\n2  Repair cost assumed at 10% of the initial purchase price\n3  Repair parts include seat, laminated seal ring, and necessary gaskets required to return the valve to like new condition\nThe total cost of ownership of Tri Lok triple offset valves compared with an integral seated triple offset valve is \nsummarized below.

It is important and critical to install the \nvalve correctly in the pipeline to assure the valve will isolate the \nproper side of the piping system. \nSeries M4 are engineered using advanced technology, featuring a \n1-piece uni-body construction, with heavy-duty drive train, 360° \nmate-lapped ball and seat with high velocity oxygen fuel (HVOF) \nand spray & fuse hard coating options and live-load packing with \nBelleville springs. \nSeries M4 severe service ball valves are ideal for service in \nconventional coal and combined cycle power generation, nuclear \nbalance of plant applications, co-generation, for boiler drains, \nfeed water drains, header drains, turbine drains, above and \nbelow seat drains, super heater vents and drains, steam drum \nvents, soot blower isolation, bypass line isolation and economizer \nheader drain applications as well as specialized applications \nincluding, power operated pressure relief valves, and sky vents.\nThe valve should be maintained as part of a preventative \nmaintenance program and in accordance with Bray’s \nrecommended pressure and temperature to ensure a long service \nlife. During shipment, storage, and in operation, the valve should \nbe fully open or fully closed (“open” is preferred for shipping and \nstorage).\nAdditional product information (such as application data, \nengineering specifications, actuator selection, etc.) is available \nfrom your local Bray distributor or sales representative, or online \nat BRAY.COM\nFor complete details on the latest product certifications,  \nvisit BRAY.COM/Certifications.\n2.2\t\nUse \nThe following instructions are designed to assist in the unpacking, \ninstallation, and maintenance as required for Bray ball valves. \nProduct users and maintenance personnel should thoroughly \nreview this manual prior to installing, operating, or performing any \nmaintenance. In most cases, Bray valves, actuators, and accessories \nare designed for specific applications (e.g. with regard to medium, \npressure and temperature). For this reason, they should not be used \nin other applications without first contacting the manufacturer.\n",

Failure to handle \nvalves properly may cause a valve to shift, slip or fall causing \nserious injury or death and/or equipment damage.\n6.1\t\nPacked Valves\nCrates: Lifting and handling of the packed valves in crates will be \ncarried out by a forklift truck, by means of the appropriate fork \nhitches.\nCases: The lifting of packed valves in cases will be carried out in \nthe lifting points and in the center of gravity position which has \nbeen marked. The transportation of all packed material must be \ncarried out safely and following the local safety regulations.\nMoving crated, packed, or palleted products must be done in a \nsafe manner, using appropriate lifting equipment (i.e., forklift, \nhand truck, pallet jack, etc.)\nNOTICE\nWhen lifting the valve from shipping container, use straps \nthrough valve body. Take care to position lifting straps to avoid \ndamage to the tubing and mounted accessories.\n6.2\t\nUnpacked Valves\nLifting and handling of valves should be carried out by using \nappropriate means and observing the carrying limits. Handling \nmust be carried out on pallets, protecting all machined surfaces \nto avoid any damage.\nWith large bore valves, rigging the load must be carried out by \nusing the appropriate tools to prevent the valve from falling or \nmoving during the lifting and handling.\nCAUTION\nProduct is shipped in protected position and must be \ntransported in such a way as to avoid damage during \nmovement.\nFor handling and/or lifting, the lifting equipment (fasteners, \nhooks, etc.) must be sized and selected while considering the \nproduct weight indicated in our packing list and/or delivery \nnote. \nLifting and handling must be performed only by qualified \npersonnel.\nFasteners must be protected by plastic covers in sharp corner \nareas.\nCaution must be taken during handling to avoid this equipment \npassing over workers, or over any other place where a possible \nfall could cause injury or damage. In all cases, local safety \nregulations must be respected.\n",

Valve should be installed so that the \nprimary sealing occurs at the low pressure end.\nIt is important and critical to install the valve correctly in the \npipeline to assure the valve will isolate the proper side of the \npiping system.\n \nFigure 5: Low and High Pressure \nLow \nPressure \nSide\nHigh\nPressure\nSide\nThe valve may be fitted in any position on the pipeline.\nBefore installing the valves, the pipes must be flushed clean of \ndirt, burrs, and welding residues, or the seats and ball surface will \nbe damaged. Check pipe end connections (threads, flanges, weld \nend connections, etc) to ensure they are not damaged.\nIf for any reason the valve is installed prior to flushing of the \npiping system, the valve must remain in the full open position \nuntil the piping system has been fully flushed clean of debris.\nEnsure the adjoining pipe on each end of the valve is aligned to \nprevent external piping loads. Piping misalignment may cause \nexcessive external loads on the valve resulting in body joint leaks.\nNOTICE\nDo not pressurize the line without an actuation device properly \ninstalled and working on the valve.\n",

A major design \nadvantage of the Series 3A/3AH is international \ncompatibility. The same valve is compatible with \nmost world flange standards:\n\t\n> ASME Class 125/150\n\t\n> BS 10 Tables D and E\n\t\n> BS 4504 NP 10/16\n\t\n> DIN ND 10/16\n\t\n> AS 2129 and JIS10. \nIn addition, the valves are designed to comply with:\n\t\n> ISO 5752 - Table 1, Series 13 (EN 558 Table 2, \nSeries 13) face-to-face\n\t\n> ISO 5211 actuator mounting flanges\nTherefore, one valve design can be used in many \ndifferent world markets.\nSERIES 3A/3AH\n 2”- 20” (50mm-500mm)\nPRESSURE RATINGS\nBIDIRECTIONAL AND DEAD END SERVICE BUBBLE TIGHT SHUT OFF \nStandard Disc*\nSeries 3A \nStandard Disc*\n2”-12” (50-300mm)\n175 psi (12 bar)\n14”-20” (350-500mm)\n150 psi (10.3 bar)\nBODY: 250 psi (17.2 bar)\n*For low pressure (50 psi) applications, Bray offers a standard reduced disc diameter to \ndecrease seating torques and extend seat life, thus increasing the valve’s performance and \nreducing actuator costs.\nVELOCITY LIMITS FOR ON/OFF SERVICES\nFLUIDS: 30 ft/sec (9 m/s)\nGASES: 175 ft/sec (54 m/s)\n1 – STEM: Precision double “D” disc to stem \nconnection drives the disc without the need for \nscrews or pins. The close tolerance, double “D” \nconnection that drives the valve disc is an exclusive \nfeature of the Bray valve. Disassembly of the Bray \nstem is just a matter of pulling the stem out of the \ndisc. \n2 – STEM RETAINING ASSEMBLY: The stem is \nretained in the body by means of a unique stainless \nsteel Spirolox® retaining ring, a thrust washer and \ntwo C-rings, manufactured from brass as standard, \nstainless steel upon request. \n3 – STEM BUSHING: Non-corrosive, heavy duty acetal \nbushing absorbs actuator side thrusts.\n4 – STEM SEAL: Double “U” cup seal design is self-\nadjusting, gives positive sealing in both directions, \nand prevents external substances from entering the \nstem bore.\n5 – PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SEALS: These \nseals prevent line media from coming in contact \nwith the stem or body. The primary seal is an \ninterference fit of the molded seat flat with the disc \nhub. The secondary seal is created because the stem \ndiameter is greater than the diameter of the seat \nstem hole.\n6 – DISC: Casting is spherically machined and hand \npolished to provide a bubble tight shutoff, minimum \ntorque, and longer seat life. Bray’s resilient Nylon 11 \ncoating comes as standard. \n7 – SEAT: Bray’s bonded seat offers lower torque and \nprovides complete isolation of flowing media from \nthe body. The seat also features a molded O-ring \nwhich eliminates the use of flange gaskets.\n8 – BODY: One piece full flanged style.

These internal, non-wetted \nconnections eliminate external disc to stem connections such as screws or taper pins.\nSpline: Male splines on the stem and female in the disc. \nStandard Sizes: 22”– 48” (550mm–1200mm) \nSelected Sizes: 54”– 120” (1400mm–3000mm)\nDOUBLE KEYED\nKeyways are machined into the disc matching keys in the stem.\nSelected Sizes: 54”– 120” (1400mm–3000mm)\nDisassembly of Bray’s internal connection is performed by simply pulling the stem out \nof the disc. All stem designs incorporate a blowout proof feature.\nSEAT DESIGN \nBray’s seat design provides complete  \nisolation of flowing media from the body \nand stem with a totally encasing design. \nThis seat is designed to seal with slip-on  \nor weld-neck flanges.\nCompetitor Strip Seat\nBray’s Seat\nBRAY TONGUE AND GROOVE SEATS\n LARGE VALVE FEATURES AND BENEFITS\n22”- 120” (550mm - 3000mm) \nCompetitor Strip Seats expose \nthe body, stem and disc stem hole to \nthe line media, thus causing premature \nfailure due to corrosion. Material costs \nare significantly increased for highly \ncorrosive applications.\nBray Seats isolate the line media from \ncontacting the body and stem, thus \nincreasing service life and therefore \nlowering costs over the life of the valve.\nAll Bray valves are pressure tested to 110% of rated pressure to assure bubble tight shutoff.\n\n\n[Images on this page: extracted_images\\en_b-1050_rsb_valves_web_p17_i1.jpeg, extracted_images\\en_b-1050_rsb_valves_web_p17_i2.jpeg, extracted_images\\en_b-1050_rsb_valves_web_p17_i3.png, extracted_images\\en_b-1050_rsb_valves_web_p17_i4.png, extracted_images\\en_b-1050_rsb_valves_web_p17_i5.png, extracted_images\\en_b-1050_rsb_valves_web_p17_i6.png, extracted_images\\en_b-1050_rsb_valves_web_p17_i7.png, extracted_images\\en_b-1050_rsb_valves_web_p17_i8.png, extracted_images\\en_b-1050_rsb_valves_web_p17_i9.png]",

The primary seal is an interference \nfit of the molded seat flat with the disc hub. The \nsecondary seal is created because the stem diameter \nis greater than the diameter of the seat stem hole.\n3 – BODY: One piece wafer style. All bodies are \ndesigned to be compatible with ASME 125/150, PN \n10 or other international flange standards.\n4 – DISC: High strength discs are spherically machined \nthen hand polished and coated with  Nylon 11. The \nsymmetrical disc profile increases CV values, reduces \nturbulence and increases pressure recovery.\n5 – SEAT: The replaceable tongue and groove seat \nto body retention method is the most advanced \ndesign in the industry. Molded o-ring eliminates the \nrequirement of flange gaskets. The seat isolates the \nvalve body and stem from line media and has been \nspecifically designed to seal with slip-on or weld-neck \nflanges.\n6 – STEM RETAINER: The steel stem retainer locks the \nstem assembly together and assists in aligning the \ndisc during assembly. This feature also makes the \nstem blow out proof.\n7 – STEM ASSEMBLY: The upper and lower shafts \nprovide a strong, positive connection to the disc and \nthe tie-rod bolting design allows for better control of \nthe disc to seat hub interferences.\nSERIES 32/33\n 22”- 36” (550mm-900mm)\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n\n\n[Images on this page: extracted_images\\en_b-1050_rsb_valves_web_p18_i1.jpeg]",

The advanced, self-adjusting \nV-Type stem packing prevents external substances from \nentering the upper stem bore. \n3 – UPPER AND LOWER STEM BEARINGS: These PTFE/\nstainless steel bearings protect the shaft and body from \nwear during pressurized cycles.\n4 – PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SEALS: These seals \nprevent line media from coming in contact with the stem \nor body. The primary seal is an interference fit of the \nmolded seat flat with the disc hub. The secondary seal \nis created because the stem diameter is greater than the \ndiameter of the seat stem hole.\n5 – BODY: One piece full flanged style. All bodies are drilled \nto be compatible with ASME 125/150, PN 10 or other \ninternational flange standards.\n6 – DISC: High strength discs are spherically machined \nthen hand polished and coated with  Nylon 11. The \nsymmetrical disc profile increases CV values, reduces \nturbulence and increases pressure recovery.\n7 – SEAT: The replaceable tongue and groove seat to body \nretention method is the most advanced design in the \nindustry. Molded o-ring eliminates the requirement of \nflange gaskets. The seat isolates the valve body and stem \nfrom line media.\n8 – STEM RETAINER: The steel stem retainer locks the stem \nassembly together and assists in aligning the disc during \nassembly.\n9 – STEM ASSEMBLY: The upper and lower shafts provide \na strong, positive connection to the disc and the tie-rod \nbolting design allows for better control of the disc to seat \nhub interferences.\n\n\n[Images on this page: extracted_images\\en_b-1050_rsb_valves_web_p20_i1.jpeg]",

This \nmechanism converts linear motion into rotational motion. The \npiston and/or springs directly couple to a rotating yoke with \na slot that engages the sliding blocks. \nThis type of actuator has a distinct torque curve, which starts \nhigh, then dips toward the middle of the stroke, and ends \nwith increasing torque — offering an inherent optimization of \ntorque requirements associated with many valve applications.\nSYMMETRICAL YOKE \n\t\n>\nTorque output curve is \nbalanced. \n\t\n>\nTorque demands are similar at \nseat break and end positions.\nCANTED YOKE\n\t\n>\nTorque output curve is shifted. \n\t\n>\nTorque demands are not the \nsame at seat break and end \npositions. \n\t\n>\nApplications for optimizing \nthe torque output vs shaft \nangle curve.\nMODULAR DESIGN\nPRESSURE MODULE\n\t\n>\nPneumatic\nTORQUE MODULE\n\t\n>\nSymmetrical or \n Canted Yoke\nHAND PUMP\n\t\n>\nHand Pump for  \nHydraulic Override\nDIRECT ACTING  \nOR SPRING RETURN \nMODULES\n\t\n>\nJackscrew  \nDirect Drive Override\n\t\n>\nJackscrew Gear Driven Override\n\t\n>\nHydraulic Override\n\t\n>\nExtended Travel Stop\n\t\n>\nHydraulic Damper\n\t\n>\nPartial Stroke Testing/Locking Device\nEMERGENCY SHUTDOWN CAPABILITY\n\t\n>\nFast Acting (less than one second) \n\t\n>\nRugged Design \n\t\n>\nCustomizable Configurations \n\t\n>\nManual and Automatic Release Options\n\t\n>\nCertified Safety Integrity Level 3 (SIL) per IEC 61508\nOPTIONS\nDAMPER \n\t\n>\nProvides self contained hydraulic cushioning at the end of \nhigh speed stroke, preventing slamming and seat damage \nto the valve, as well as shock to the piping.

Guide Ball Valves_20240813\nBRAY BALL VALVE TECHNICAL BULLETIN NO. 1005\nACTUATOR SELECTION GUIDE - BALL VALVES\nProper actuator selection is needed to ensure consistent operation of the automated valve. Selecting the \nproper actuator begins with establishing valve operating torque. Valve operating torque is determined \nby seating material, operation frequency, media type and line pressure. This guide provides a means of \ndetermining the valve operating torque based on these variables.\nTHE FOLLOWING STEPS ARE USED TO SELECT THE PROPER ACTUATOR\n1.\t\nAfter selecting the desired seating material, refer to the charts on the following pages to determine \nthe basic torque requirement for the valve.\n2.\t\nUsing the design or maximum operating line pressure and the valve size chose the Valve Torque \nRequirement from the tables.* If line pressure is not listed, the next highest pressure nearest the \nactual pressure should be selected (example: for 285 psi use 300 psi). Please reference the notes at \nthe bottom of each page for additional instructions\n3.\t\nDetermine the Application Factor from Chart 1. Select the largest factor if the service application \nmatches more than one of the listed factors.\n4.\t\nDetermine the Design Factor from Chart 2.\n5.\t\nDetermine the Frequency of Operation Factor from Chart 3.\n6.\t\nAdd the Application Factor, Design Factor, and the Frequency of Operation Factor to determine the \nTotal Torque Factor.\n7.\t\nMultiply the torque from the tables per item 2 by the Total Torque Factor per item 6 to determine \nthe Total Valve Torque Requirement. This will be the torque needed to size the actuator.\n8.\t\nIf a Media Containment Unit is added between the valve and the actuator, the additional torque \nlisted in Chart 4 must be added to the Total Valve Torque Requirement. This new value will now be \nthe Total Valve Torque Requirement.\n9.\t\nFrom the actuator output torque tables select an actuator with an output torque greater than the \nTotal Valve Torque Requirement.\nPNEUMATIC ACTUATORS\n\t\n>\nDouble Acting (Air-to-Air): Determine the air supply pressure available to the actuator and select \nthe Actuator Size that exceeds the Total Valve Torque Requirement.\n\t\n>\nSingle Acting (Spring Return for fail safe operation, either Fail-Open or Fail-Close): Determine \nthe air supply available to the actuator and select the Actuator Size that exceeds the Total Valve \nTorque Requirement for the END of stroke for BOTH the Air Stroke and the Spring Stroke. The \nactuator selection is optimized when the end of stroke torques are nearly equal. \nELECTRIC ACTUATORS\n\t\n>\nMultiply the Total Valve Torque Requirement by a safety factor of 1.2. Select the Actuator Size \nthat exceeds that amount.\n10.\t From the EZ Ordering Code Matrix select the mounting kit required to connect the valve and \nactuator. EZ Ordering Codes are listed by valve series.\n",

This high initial torque is the \nresult of the ball and seats taking a set after sitting in a \nstatic position for a period of time. As the ball is turned \nthe torque decreases. This is known as the Run Torque, \nand it will be approximately 75% of the break torque. The \ntorque will again increase at the end of the stroke as the \nball and seats are returned to full contact. This torque \nis known as Ending Torque, and it will be approximately \n90% of the Break Torque. This typical curve occurs in both \ndirections when operating a ball valve open to closed or \nclosed to open.\nBreak \n(100%)\nEnding\n(90%)\nRun\n(75%)\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nTorque %\nStart\nEnd\nStroke\nTYPICAL VALVE TORQUE CURVE\nEnd\nELECTRIC ACTUATOR\nTORQUE CURVE\nElectric Actuators have a \nconstant output torque \nthroughout travel from \nstart to end, clock-wise or \ncounter-clock-wise rotation.\nStart\nPNEUMATUIC \nACTUATOR\nSINGLE ACTING\nTORQUE CURVE\nStart\nStart\nEnd\nEnd\nCounterclockwise (Air Stroke)\nClockwise (Spring Stroke)\n",

Guide Ball Valves_20240813\nBRAY BALL VALVE TECHNICAL BULLETIN NO. 1005\nACTUATOR SELECTION GUIDE - BALL VALVES\nEXAMPLES OF HOW TO SIZE AN ACTUATOR\nSelect Bray Double Acting (Air-to-Air) pneumatic actuator, Single Acting (Spring Return) pneumatic \nactuator and a Bray Electric Actuator for the following application:\n\t\n>\nValve: 2” F15, Full Port – Line Pressure: 200 psi – Line Media: Saturated Steam – Seat \nMaterial: Tek-Fil® \n\t\n>\nActuator Air Supply Pressure: 80 psig — Frequency of operation: 4 times per day.\nStep 1\t\nDetermine The Torque Requirement\nRefer to the Valve Torque Requirements chart for a Tek-Fil® seat. A 2” valve with line pressure of \n200 psi has a torque requirement of 380 lb-in. The application is for Saturated Steam so use an \nApplication Factor of 1.3. The valve has a plain round port, so use a Design Factor of 0.0. The \nfrequency of operation is 4 times per day so use a Frequency Factor of 0.0. The total torque \nfactor is 1.3 (1.3 + 0.0 + 0.0 = 1.3).\n\t\n>\nValve Torque Requirement: 380 x 1.3 = 494 lb-in.\n\t\n>\nNote: This valve does not use a Media Containment Unit so no additional torque is required.\nStep 2  Select the Correct Actuator Size\nDouble Acting Pneumatic Actuator, with Air Supply pressure of 80 psig\nFrom the Double Acting Pneumatic Operated Output chart select the size actuator that \nexceeds 494 lb-in with an 80 psig air supply. The size 83 actuator (smallest actuator size that \nhas torque above valve torque) has a torque output of 721 lb-in. \nCorrect Actuator: Size 83\nSpring Return Pneumatic Actuator, with Air Supply pressure of 80 psig\nFrom the Spring Return Pneumatic Operated Output chart select the size actuator that exceeds \n494 lb-in with an 80 psig air supply. FOR SPRING RETURN THE ENDING OF THE AIR STROKE \nAND THE SPRING STROKE MUST EXCEED THE VALVE TORQUE REQUIREMENT OF 494 lb-in. \nThe first actuator to accomplish this is the size 119 with 3 springs (air end 1287 lb-in, spring \nstroke 549 lb-in). The next size actuator is a 119 with 4 springs (air end 993 lb-in, spring end \n732 lb-in). The end stroke of torque on a 119-4 is more balanced and it allows for changes in \nservice conditions.\nCorrect Actuator: Size 119-3 or 119-4. Depending on the application data and air supply \nconsistency.\nElectric Actuator\nThe Application Factors for Series 70 ON/OFF is 1.2. Valve Torque Requirement: \n494  lb-in x 1.2 = 592.8 lb-in. \nFrom the Electric Actuator Torque Output charts select the size actuator that exceeds \n592.8 lb-in.\nCorrect Actuator: Size S70-006 (torque output of 600 lb-in) \nStep 3\t\nSelect the Mounting Kit to Connect the Valve and Actuator\nRefer to the EZ Ordering Code Matrix for 2” F15, Full Port valve.\nPneumatic Double Acting: \t2” F15 valve with size 083 actuator requires EZ-005.\nPneumatic Spring Return: \t 2” F15 valve with size 119-4 actuator requires EZ-010.\nElectric: \t\t\n\t\n2” F15 valve with size S70-006 actuator requires EZ-005.\n",

Now, with the \ndevelopment of Flow-Tek’s characterized \nV-balls, a full range of control applications \nis available with superior flow control. \nThese 1/4 turn control ball valves are more \ncompact, lighter weight and much less \nexpensive than comparably sized globe valves \noffered by other companies. Flow-Tek control \nvalves offer fast response times to control \nsignals due to advanced digital control of \nactuation and the inherent strengths of ball \nvalves. These valves exceed Class VI offering \nbubble tight shut off with zero leakage. \nOther features include superior rangeabiltiy \nand repeatability, high flow capacity, the \nability to function with fluids containing \nlight solids and fibers, ease of maintenance \nand exceptional interface with PLCs and \ncomputer command signals. Flow-Tek \nhigh quality pneumatic and electric control \nactuators are very durable and efficient. \nIncreased Linear Response\nDue to the in-line design inherent with \ncharacterized control ball valves, line media \nflows linearly through the piping system. \nThe direct pattern provides increased \nmedia control and rapid response times to \ncontroller commands.\nExceptional Characterized Control \nFlow-Tek’s characterized balls provide predictable and accurate control \nof downstream flow rates. These precision cut balls closely match \nthe control performance of globe valves while offering the economy, \nfeatures and reduced size and weight of ball valves. Flow-Tek offers a \nwide range of V-Port and Slotted Port characterized balls. The standard \ncharacterized balls and an example of a custom ball are shown above. \nThe 90° and 60° balls, like standard round hole balls, offer an equal \npercentage inherent flow characteristic. A slotted ball and a V-Port ball \nwith a small angle opening, such as a 15° ball, furnish a linear inherent \nflow characteristic. Medium angle V-Port valves such as a 30° ball furnish \na modified equal percentage inherent flow characteristic. Custom ports \nare also available to meet special control requirements. Designed with \nflexibility in process conditions in mind, the Cv and control characteristics \nare easily changed by simply changing the ball. \nHigh Rangeability\nThe characterized ball delivers controllable flow characteristics from the \nnearly closed to the fully open position of the valve. Though port type \nand valve size affects the rangeability, Flow-Tek characterized balls have \na minimum rangeability of 200 to 1 and can exceed 800 to 1. Flow rates \nare highly repeatable within the normal 20% – 80% range of travel.\nHigh Flow Capacity\nFlow-Tek’s control ball valves have been designed to offer maximum flow \ncharacteristics that are substantially higher than comparably sized globe \nvalves. The inherent flow pattern of ball valves increases flow rates and \nin many applications valves smaller than pipeline size can be used, saving \nthe customer money. The self-cleaning action of the ball against the seat \nmakes the ball valve acceptable for light slurry and fiber media services.\nHigh Pressure Drops\nEngineered to withstand high pressure drops while providing leak free \noperation, the V-Control Series delivers the precision control required \nby today’s process industries. The ∆P limit for liquids is one third (1⁄3) the \ninlet pressure up to 500psi and steam is up to 300psi. Please consult the \nfactroy or your distributor for information on control valve sizing and \npressure drop limitations.\nBidirectional Bubble Tight Shut Off\nV-Control Series ball valves offer bidirectional bubble tight above Class VI shut off \nin compliance with FCI 70-2 standards. \nCustom V Port\n60° V-Port\n30° V-Port\nCustom Slotted Port\n90° V-Port\n15° V-Port\nMedia flow entering the valve from the left. \nInstalling the V downstream is preferred. \n\n\n[Images on this page: extracted_images\\F-2600_EN_VC_p2_i1.jpeg, extracted_images\\F-2600_EN_VC_p2_i2.jpeg, extracted_images\\F-2600_EN_VC_p2_i3.jpeg, extracted_images\\F-2600_EN_VC_p2_i4.jpeg, extracted_images\\F-2600_EN_VC_p2_i5.jpeg, extracted_images\\F-2600_EN_VC_p2_i6.jpeg]",

          "content": "ADVANCED V-CONTROL BALL VALVES | 3\nCONTROL VALVES\nHysteresis\nFlow-Tek control valve packages are inherently designed to limit as \nmuch hysteresis as possible. This is a very important feature in throttling \ncontrol. Flow-Tek valves are designed with a tight connection between \nball and stem, and the large stem diameter increases the connection \nsurface. Both ball and stem connections are precision machined to tight \ntolerances limiting hysteresis. The Flow-Tek design does not require \nhand matching of balls and stems to insure a tight connection. Standard \nvalves can be converted to V-Port control valves in the field. Heavy duty \nbrackets and couplers connect valves to actuators. Pneumatic actuator \npistons have standard guide bearings to minimize side movement within \nthe actuator body. All connections are manufactured to tight tolerances \nthroughout the control valve package.\nBall Design\nAll Flow-Tek valves offer a precision machined, mirror finished, solid \nstainless steel ball. As with standard Flow-Tek round hole balls, the \ncritical edges of the V-Port and slotted balls have blended curvatures to \nreduce seat wear and provide a high cycle life. Flow-Tek control valves \nhave the cut in the ball instead of the seat – offering advantages of \nimproved flexibility, durability and serviceability. \nFlexibility\nWide range of ball materials offered based on application. Converting \nfrom a standard round port valve to a V-Port control valve is simply a \nmatter of replacing the ball, all other valve parts remain the same. \nDurability\nThe pressure drop in a control valve is taken over the edges of the \ncontrol element. Focusing the actual pressure drop at the edges of \na V in the ball instead of in a soft seat material provides for a more \ndurable product. \nServiceability\nWhen seat replacement is necessary, the center section of a Flow‑Tek \n3-piece valve can easily swing out for servicing. Competitors’ valves, \nwith the cut in the seat, require special end caps with a recess to \naccommodate the special seats. Their end caps cannot swing out, \nrequiring the valve to be completely removed from the line for \nservicing. Flow-Tek valves utilize standard end caps and seats for \nenhanced serviceability. \nThese curves of \nstandard ports \nare general \nguidelines and \nare not specific \nto any particular \nvalve size.\nCharacterized Control\n0°\n10°\n20°\nPercent Open\nv\nC\n30°\n40°\n50°\n60°\n70°\n80°\n90°\n90° V Port\nRound Bore\n60° V Port\n30° V Port\n15° V Port\n1/8\" Slotted Port\nStem Seals & Seats\nLeak-free protection is achieved by Flow-\nTek’s stem packing design, live-loaded \nself-adjusting stem seals and superior seat \nconstruction. In combination with the \nlong lasting service capabilities of Flow-Tek \nactuators, V-Control Series ball valves have \na much higher cycle life than most control \nvalves. With a low coefficient of friction and \nhigh resistance to erosion and corrosion, \nFlow-Tek valves are built to last. \nSeat Selection\nA wide range of seat materials are offered \nto meet most applications. Seats include: \nTek‑Fil®, PEEK, RPTFE, TFM 1600, stainless \nsteel/PTFE (50/50), UHMWPE, and seats \noffering high temperature and high pressure \ncapabilities. Metal and other seats are \navailable, please consult the factory. \nApplications\nTemperature Control - With shut off \nexceeding Class VI requirements, these valves \nare ideal for steam/temperature control.\nFlow Control - The high flow capacity and \npredictable rangeability and repeatability of \nthe V-Control Series valves make this the \nideal choice for flow control services.\nSteam Control - The V-Control Series \nprovides tight shutoff and utilizes Flow-Tek’s \nlive loaded Smart Stem design to eliminate \ntypical problems of downstream leakage and \nstem leakage associated with globe style \nsteam control valves.\nLevel Control & PH Service - A combination \nof Flow-Tek V-Control valve, \nactuation and accessories \nare the ideal package \nfor these applications.\nMedia Containment \nUnits - Extended \nstem sealing \nunits are \ndesigned to \nprevent costly \ndowntime and \nprovide double stem \nsealing. A button-head \ncheck valve for injection \nof a sealing agent can be \nadded.\n\n\n[Images on this page: extracted_images\\F-2600_EN_VC_p3_i1.jpeg]",

          "content": "ADVANCED V-CONTROL BALL VALVES | 7\nELECTRIC CONTROLS\nDeviceNet\nAn economical internationally recognized \nfieldbus network, DeviceNet is used to \nconnect devices such as sensors and \nactuators while providing access to the \nintelligence present in those devices. Polled \nmessages exchange data many times per \nsecond. Each scanner card in a PLC allows \nup to 64 devices to communicate with each \nother over a single cable. PLCs may use \nmultiple scanners to connect as many devices \nas required.\nDeviceNet Advantages\nThe DeviceNet fieldbus network greatly \nincreases plant operation flexibility, efficiency \nand maintenance, and reduces installation \nand engineering costs. \nFlexibility - A wide variety of devices, such \nas control valves, sensors, motor controllers, \npump controls, scanners, etc., can be \ninstalled along the DeviceNet trunk line by \nmeans of tap connectors. Devices can be \nremoved or replaced while the network is \noperational. Additional devices can be added \nby simply connecting them to the existing \nbus line.\nEfficiency - The two way communication \ncapacity of the network allows devices to \nprovide information back to the controller, \nas well as respond to commands. Precise \nactuator position control and modification \nof parameters, such as valve travel limits and \nactuator speeds, can be easily performed. \nThe entire plant can be controlled and \nmonitored from a remote location.\nMaintenance - Diagnostic information such \nas motor temperature and current can be \neasily accessed from both local and remote \nlocations over the network. Therefore, \nmaintenance schedules can be planned and \nmodified based on live information.\nInstallation - Traditionally, plant controllers \nrequire one to two wires per function, per \ndevice. These wires must be physically run \nand identified throughout the plant. The \nlabor, material, engineering and record \nkeeping for any control system is time \nconsuming and expensive. The DeviceNet \nfieldbus network eliminates these costs, \ndelivering tremendous overall savings and \nenhanced performance.\nBusSmart Electric Actuators\nThe Flow-Tek BusSmart DeviceNet Servo is microprocessor controlled and \nserial bus connected using firmware specifically designed to complement \nthe capabilities of the Automator Series 70 Electric Actuator. The \nmicroprocessor continually responds to commands from the process \ncontroller or PLC, supplying information such as valve position, limit \nswitch positions, and other parameters through a single network \naddress, or MAC ID. The BusSmart Servo is fully ODVA (Open DeviceNet \nVendor Association) compliant and can be configured, monitored and \ncontrolled over a single DeviceNet cable.\nFeatures\nThe BusSmart Servo has the following features: LED Indicators – Power, \nNetwork/Module Status, Motor Running Open, Motor Running Closed \nand Calibration Status; Network Adjustable Parameters – Command \nSignal, Speed Control, Instant Reverse Delay, Service Notes, Reset, \nRestore Default Settings and Remote Autocalibration; Network Viewable \nParameters – Actual Position, Motor Temperature, Motor Current and \nSerial Number.\nOperation\nThe BusSmart Servo is easy to install and configure, similar to connecting \na printer to a personal computer. Network communication wiring is \naccomplished through a single DeviceNet standard five-pin connector \ncable, and power to drive the actuator motor is brought to a terminal \nstrip inside the actuator. Installation costs are greatly reduced. \nConfiguration of features is made with Electronic Data Sheets (EDS) files \nand commercially available software. Calibration is a simple automatic \nprocess accomplished without complicated potentiometer and switch \nsettings, and may be made with or without connection to the network. \nAll configuration settings are stored in non-volatile memory and will \nsurvive power outages.\nElectronic Data Sheet (EDS)\nFlow-Tek‘s EDS simplifies installation, commissioning and monitoring. \nConfiguration of features is made with EDS files and commercially \navailable software that uses the EDS to present a clear graphic user \ninterface for remote viewing and control. Similar to a spreadsheet, the \nEDS describes the various supported features of the BusSmart Servo.\nTypical installation of Series 70 DeviceNet Actuator\n\n\n[Images on this page: extracted_images\\F-2600_EN_VC_p7_i1.jpeg]",

          "content": "3-Piece Valves\nTriad Series Valves \nTriad Series ball valves are designed for \nheavy duty, high pressure applications and \nfeature a redundant body seal. \n7000/8000 Series Valves\n7000/8000 Series ball valves are available \nin a wide range of end connections and \nseat materials. \nFlanged Valves\nF15/F30 – RF15/RF30 Series Valves \nFlow-Tek flanged ball valves are ideal for \nindustrial applications. Larger F15/F30 \nvalves feature ball suport.\nStem Assemblies\nFlow-Tek features heavy duty, high quality stem designs with double “D” \nconnections to ball and operator mounting. This connection simplifies \nmounting and indicates direction of flow. Stems are mated with the ball to \nensure positive contact. All Flow-Tek stems are internal entry and blowout proof \nfor maximum safety. \nSmart Stem: Valve Sizes ½” through 2½” \nFlow-Tek’s control valves feature strong, large diameter stems with live-loaded, \nself-adjusting sealing utilizing belleville washers that automatically adjust to \ncompensate for changes in temperature and wear. Manual adjustments that \ncan cause damage to the seal are not required. The assembly is secured by a \nsaddle-type lock washer that prevents stem nuts from unthreading in high cycle \nautomation applications.\nStem Design: Valve Sizes 3” through 12”\nThe stem is guided by the valve body and the gland, ensuring smooth operation \neven in high torque service. The independent packing gland can be easily \nadjusted without removing mounting hardware or actuator. The self aligning \npacking gland and gland sleeve equally distribute the load in the event one \nside is over tightened. All stems are polished to reduce torque. For severe \napplications, optional belleville washers can be added for a self-adjusting live \nload, providing a continuous compression seal.\nFire Safe Valves\nFlow-Tek 3-Piece and flanged valves are available as non-fire safe and fire safe \nto API 607 standards. Flow-Tek’s standard fire safe design features metal to \nmetal, ball to body contact during and after a fire, graphite stem packing, \nthrust bearings made of stainless steel/PTFE, and graphite body seals. \nAnti-static Protection\nFlow-Tek stems feature anti-static grounding devices as standard. These devices \nensure electrical continuity between valve ball, stem and body, thus eliminating \nthe possibility of static electric charges creating sparks within the valve.\nActuator Mounting\nAll V-Control Series ball valves feature Flow-Tek’s Secure Mount actuator \ntop plate mounting. The mounting is designed in accordance with ISO 5211 \nstandards. \nFor more detailed information please refer to valve brochures in the Product Manual.\n†Consult Flow-Tek factory or your distributor for infomation on control valve sizing and pressure drop limitations.         * Limited to ASME pressure rating for Class 150 valves.\nBALL VALVES\nValve Type\nPorting\nBody\nMaterials\nSizes \n(ins)\nPressure  \nRating ASME\nPressure\nDrop Limit†\nSeat\nMaterials\nEnd\nConnections\n3-Piece:\nTriad\nFull Port & \nStandard Port\nStainless Steel & \nCarbon Steel\nFull Port: ½” to 4”\nStd.
